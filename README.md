## Repository navigation

-   If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [`codelists`](./codelists) folder.

-   Analyses scripts are in the [`analysis`](./analysis) directory:

    -   If you are interested in how we defined our variables, we use study definition scripts to define three cohorts: pre-vaccination, vaccinated and unvaccinated. Study start dates (i.e., index) and end dates differ by cohort and are all described in the protocol. Hence, we have a study definition for each; these are written in `python`. Extracted data is then combined to create our final cohorts, in the [preprocess data script](analysis/preprocess/preprocess_data.R).
    -   This directory also contains all the R scripts that process, describe, and analyse the extracted data.

-   The [`lib/`](./lib) directory contains a list of active analyses.

-   The [`project.yaml`](.project.yaml) defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts. This file should not be edited directly. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the [`create_project.R`](./analysis/create_project.R) script which generates all the actions.


## Manuscript

This manuscript is currently being drafted.

## Code

The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) defines project actions, run-order and dependencies for all analysis scripts. **This file should *not* be edited directly**. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the [`create_project.R`](./analysis/create_project.R) script instead. Project actions are then run securely using [OpenSAFELY Jobs](https://jobs.opensafely.org/repo/https%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fopensafely%252Fpost-covid-vaccinated). Details of the purpose and any published outputs from this project can be found at this link as well.

Below is a description of each action in the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) with arguments denoted by {arg} in the action name:
